## How to install the UX improvement userscript

1. Make sure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed. [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) is a link to the Chrome Web Store page for it, and [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) it is for Mozilla Firefox.
2. Click [this link](https://github.com/ph0t0shop/keymash/raw/master/keymash-ux-improvement.user.js). Tampermonkey should prompt you to install a script. Do so.
3. You're done! You can customize/toggle all aspects of the script in the [keymash settings tab](https://keyma.sh/settings).
